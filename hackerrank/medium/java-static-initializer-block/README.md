## Problem

Static initialization blocks are executed when the class is loaded, and you can initialize static variables in those blocks.

It's time to test your knowledge of *Static initialization blocks*. You can read about it [here.](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/initial.html)  

You are given a class *Solution* with a *main* method. Complete the given code so that it outputs the area of a parallelogram with breadth $B$ and height $H$. You should read the variables from the standard input.

If $B \le 0$ or $H$ $ \le 0$, the output should be *"java.lang.Exception: Breadth and height must be positive"* without quotes.



**Input Format**

There are two lines of input. The first line contains $B$: the breadth of the parallelogram. The next line contains $H$: the height of the parallelogram.





**Constraints**

* $ -100 \le B \le 100$  
* $  -100 \le H \le 100$  

**Output Format**

If both values are greater than zero, then the *main* method must output the area of the *parallelogram*. Otherwise, print *"java.lang.Exception: Breadth and height must be positive"* without quotes.

**Sample input 1**

  	1
    3
    
**Sample output 1**

	3
**Sample input 2**

  	-1
    2
    
**Sample output 2**

	java.lang.Exception: Breadth and height must be positive

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int lineNumber = 1;

        while (sc.hasNext()) {
            String line = sc.nextLine();
            System.out.println(lineNumber + " " + line);
            lineNumber++;
        }

        sc.close();
    }
}

```
